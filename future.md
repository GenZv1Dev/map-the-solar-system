get the assets for the demos below and get 4k textures and better materials and assets from: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js (git clone it and get it from there)

test three js examples here: https://threejs.org/examples/

add firey torando effects to some planets: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/refs/heads/master/examples/webgpu_tsl_vfx_tornado.html

improve the galaxy around the solar system: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/refs/heads/master/examples/webgpu_tsl_galaxy.html

add 4k textures to earth: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/refs/heads/master/examples/webgpu_tsl_earth.html

add unreal bloom to some planets that need it: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/refs/heads/master/examples/webgl_postprocessing_unreal_bloom.html

add water to some planets that need it (can be a subtle effect on earth when you zoom in its ocean areas)
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/refs/heads/master/examples/webgpu_ocean.html
and it can also be used on some other planets if you know they have water idk

add this fire smoke effect to some places that need them like the sun https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/refs/heads/master/examples/webgpu_particles.html

add this very cool lava effects to planets that need them and of course all over the sun surface https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/refs/heads/master/examples/webgl_shader_lava.html

if you need a liquidy planet like maybe mercuray maybe you can use this as the planet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/refs/heads/master/examples/webgl_marchingcubes.html and other planets that may need them

if possible make the earth height map work like in this example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/refs/heads/master/examples/webgl_loader_3dtiles.html but make sure you still use the similar 4k textures for night and day and everything we have... this needs to be on top of it not instead of it..

add this awesome shine les flare coming from the sun https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/refs/heads/master/examples/webgl_lensflares.html

see if we can use instancing to improve the perforamnce of astreoids even further on top of the webgl_batch_lod_bvh.html optimizations we added
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/refs/heads/master/examples/webgl_instancing_performance.html
